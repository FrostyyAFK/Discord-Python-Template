# Discord-Python-Template

This repository is a template that everyone can use for the start of their discord bot.

When I first started creating my discord bot it took me a while to get everything setup and working with cogs and more. I would've been happy if there were any template existing. However, there wasn't any existing template. That's why I decided to create my own template to let you guys create your discord bot easily.

Please note that this template is not supposed to be the best template, but a good template to start learning how discord.py works and to make your own bot in a simple way.

If you plan to use this template to make your own template or bot, you have to give me credits somewhere and keep the copyright notice on the files, see the https://github.com/FrostyyAFK/Discord-Python-Template/blob/main/LICENSE for more info about the license.
